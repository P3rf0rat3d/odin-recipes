    <h2>The perfect modern Beef Stew recipe for a cool evening dinner</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs beef, chuck roast, fat trimmed, cut into 1-2-inch chunks
        </li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced thinly
        </li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, sliced diagonally in thick pieces
        </li>
        <li>6 carrots, sliced diagonally in thick pieces
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons small tapioca </li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato juice
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar
        </li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li> Place everything in the Instant Pot. Select the stew/meat setting (about 35 minutes, high pressure). After it’s done, let everything mellow out for about 10 minutes before releasing the steam. Technically at this point, it’s done. But I recommend finishing with a quick browning session in the oven.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 320 degrees. Place all ingredients in a baking dish – it can be glass or ceramic (we use a round casserole dish – something between 8×8 and 9×13). Cover with foil and bake for 3-4 hours. If the gravy dries out, you can add a little water to the gravy to loosen it up before serving.</li>
        <li>Whether you make this in the oven or in the Instant Pot, I recommend finishing by giving it about 10-20 minutes in a hot oven (400-ish degrees), uncovered, before serving. It gets the meat nice and caramelized on top and helps the gravy thicken up.</li>
    </ol>
